# Deployment Troubleshooting Plan

## Issue Identified
The deployed application at https://iumvzyko.manus.space is not rendering correctly. The browser is showing JavaScript code instead of the actual application interface, indicating client-side hydration issues with the static export.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Next.js applications with client components require proper hydration on the client side
2. Static exports have limitations with dynamic features and client-side rendering
3. API routes that use request.headers cannot be properly rendered statically

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Server-Side Rendering Deployment
- Deploy to a platform that supports Next.js server-side rendering (Vercel)
- This would allow proper hydration of client components
- API routes would function correctly with dynamic features

### Approach 2: Modify Application for Static Export
- Remove dependencies on request.headers in API routes
- Create fallback static data for API endpoints
- Implement client-side data fetching instead of relying on API routes
- Use localStorage for state persistence instead of server-side sessions

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach
- Deploy static assets to CDN for performance
- Deploy API functionality to serverless functions
- Configure routing to direct API requests to serverless functions

## Implementation Plan
1. Prepare application for Vercel deployment
2. Configure build settings for optimal performance
3. Set up environment variables for API keys and services
4. Deploy to Vercel with server-side rendering enabled
5. Test all functionality in the deployed environment
6. Configure custom domain if available

## Fallback Plan
If Vercel deployment is not possible, implement Approach 2 by modifying the application for pure static export with client-side data handling.
