Many successful sellers use both platforms to maximize visibility.",
    "The best pricing strategy depends on your product positioning and competition. For unique products, value-based pricing allows you to charge based on perceived value. For commodity items, competitive pricing is essential. Consider starting slightly higher and using promotional discounts to test price sensitivity while maintaining your target profit margin.",
    "To reduce shipping costs, negotiate rates with multiple carriers, use lightweight packaging materials, and consider offering economy shipping options. For international sales, using fulfillment services like Amazon FBA can be cost-effective. Always compare dimensional weight versus actual weight pricing, and consider flat-rate shipping options for consistency.",

Implement a reliable inventory tracking system, establish reorder points that account for lead times, and regularly review slow-moving items.
