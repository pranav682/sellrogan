# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
The application has been deployed to https://yafhxins.manus.space, but there appears to be an issue with how the JavaScript is being loaded or executed. The page is showing raw JavaScript code instead of rendering the application interface.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

### 1. Next.js Static Export Configuration

The issue might be related to how Next.js generates static exports. For proper static exports with client-side navigation:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

The `trailingSlash: true` option can help with routing in static hosting environments, and `images.unoptimized: true` is necessary for static exports.

### 2. API Routes in Static Exports

Next.js API routes (like our `/api/search` endpoint) don't work in static exports since they require a server. For static deployments, we need to:

1. Move API functionality to client-side
2. Use serverless functions (like Cloudflare Workers)
3. Create a separate API service

### 3. Alternative Deployment Options

If the static export continues to have issues, consider these alternatives:

#### Vercel Deployment
Vercel is optimized for Next.js applications:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
cd price-arbitrage-web
vercel
```

#### Netlify Deployment
Netlify also works well with Next.js:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
cd price-arbitrage-web
netlify deploy
```

### 4. Client-Side Only Version

For a purely static deployment, we could create a client-side only version:

1. Remove server components and API routes
2. Use client-side data fetching with mock data
3. Focus on the UI demonstration aspects

### 5. Packaging the Application

If deployment continues to be challenging, we can package the entire application for local use:

```bash
cd price-arbitrage-app
zip -r price-arbitrage-app.zip .
```

This allows the user to run the application locally or deploy it using their preferred method.

## Next Steps

1. Try modifying the Next.js configuration with the suggested changes
2. Test with an alternative deployment platform like Vercel or Netlify
3. Consider creating a simplified client-side only version for demonstration
4. Package the complete source code for the user to deploy using their preferred method

The most important thing is to ensure the user has access to the application's functionality, whether through a deployed version or by providing them with the complete source code and deployment instructions.
